  "A short tutorial on building a sentiment analysis model and deploying it as a
  REST API with Beam"

### Define the environment

The first thing we'll do is define the environment that our app will run on. For
this example, we're building a Sentiment Analysis model using Huggingface.

First, create a file with your Beam App definition. You can name this whatever
you want. In this example, we'll call it `app.py`.

```python app.py
import beam

app = beam.App(
    name="sentiment-analysis",
    cpu=4,
    memory="4Gi",
    gpu=0,
    python_version="python3.9",
    python_packages=["transformers", "torch"],
)
```

### Invoking the Huggingface Model

Now, we'll write some code to predict the sentiment of a given text prompt.
Create a new file. Again, you can name this whatever you want. We'll name ours
`inference.py`

Our function takes keyword arguments, as `(**inputs)`.

```python inference.py
from transformers import pipeline

def predict_sentiment(**inputs):
    model = pipeline(
        "sentiment-analysis", model="siebert/sentiment-roberta-large-english"
    )
    result = model(inputs["prompt"], truncation=True, top_k=1)
    prediction = {i["label"]: i["score"] for i in result}

    print(prediction)

    return prediction
```

### Setting a REST API Trigger

To deploy the API, we'll create a REST API **Trigger** in our `app.py`.

Our trigger requires three things:

- **Inputs -** _the name and type of all_ **_inputs_** _to the API_

- **Outputs** \- _the name and type of all_ _**outputs**_ _returned from the
  API_

- **Handler** \- _the file and function to be invoked when the API is called_

Add the following lines to your `app.py` file:

```python app.py
app.Trigger.RestAPI(
    inputs={"text": beam.Types.String()},
    outputs={"prediction": beam.Types.String()},
    handler="inference.py:predict_sentiment",
)
```

The complete `app.py` file will look like this:

```python app.py
import beam

app = beam.App(
    name="sentiment-analysis",
    cpu=4,
    memory="4Gi",
    gpu=0,
    python_version="python3.9",
    python_packages=["transformers", "torch"],
)

app.Trigger.RestAPI(
    inputs={"text": beam.Types.String()},
    outputs={"prediction": beam.Types.String()},
    handler="inference.py:predict_sentiment",
)
```

### Deploying the app

To deploy the model, enter your terminal and `cd` to the directory you're
working on.

Then, run the following:

```
beam deploy app.py
```

Once you deploy, you'll see the following console output:

![](/img/beam/getting-started/call-api.png)

At the bottom of the console, you'll see a URL for invoking your function.
Here's what a cURL request would look like:

```bash
curl -X POST --compressed https://beam.eng-stage.slai.io/dzzf3/ \
 -H 'Accept: \*/\*' \
 -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' \
 -H 'Authorization: Basic ZGQ2MzY3NGMyZmYwYzMwNjU1YTM1ODVkM2I4OTQzYmE6ZDIwNWJhMTk1ZGQ2ZTdmZDFjNDE5ODQyYjQ1Nzk0YTY=' \
 -d '{"text": "I think baseball is overrated"}'
```

<Note>
**The requests are authenticated with basic auth.** For the beta, your credentials are simply: `Username: user` and `Password: user`

</Note>

Congrats - you just deployed your first function on Beam!
